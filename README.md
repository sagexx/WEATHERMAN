#Weather App

This 5 day weather forecast app was created using JavaScript and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app takes user input for the city and fetches the weather data from the API to display the minimum and maximum temperatures, as well as the corresponding weather icons for the upcoming five days.

To use the app, simply enter the name of the desired city in the input field and click the "Search" button. The app will display the weather forecast for the next five days, including the corresponding weather icons.

If the entered city name is not found in the OpenWeatherMap API database, the app will display an error message prompting the user to check their spelling and try again.

Additionally, the app defaults to displaying the weather forecast for Seattle upon page load, and the days of the week are automatically displayed based on the current date.

Overall, this app is a simple and effective way to quickly view the weather forecast for the next five days in a specific city.
